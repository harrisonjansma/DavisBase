This program was written in Python 3.6, and the only dependency is sqlparse

To get sqlparse:
pip install sqlparse

to run the code:
python davisbase.py


To test the backend functionality I have also included the python program test_backend.py.
This program shows that the program is capable of binarizing data, adding/updating/deleteing from a table-btree, and matces specifications laid out in the nano file.

python test_backend.py
